- Generate a new, unique `secret_key` in `config/initializers/devise.rb` by using `$ rake secret`
- Create a `cloudinary.yml` and `database.yml` file in the `config` directory. Configure them with your settings. A `cloudinary-sample.yml` and `database-sample.yml` have been provided as an example. 
- Set up the DB with `$ rake db:schema:load`
- Run `$ unicorn -c config/unicorn.rb`
- Set up an admin user by going to `localhost:8080/admins/sign_up`
